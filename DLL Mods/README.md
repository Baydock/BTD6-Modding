## Descriptions: 
**Damage Costs Money**
 - This mod makes the game solely reliant on how much cash you have. Simply put, bloons leaked costs you cash instead of lives, and if you get to 0 cash then it's game over! Also, every 10 rounds the leaks get more expensive. Inspiration from Tewtiy's video, original Mod idea from DisabledMallis.

**InfRange**
- Rather self explanatory mod, took the framework of Gurren's Hypersonic+infinite range and just removed Hypersonic.

**MoneyStuff**
- Cheat mod that will continuously give you cash until the game is over. Works only for singleplayer. On each game instance where there is an AddCash event, the mod gives you an extra 100 cash every time.
